# odin-recipes
This website is a project to test, and build my knowledge of html. I tried to use a little of everything I learned just to make sure I could it all. It was helpful, and helped me to encode the information better. I linked back to the source pages for the recipes so I could practice, and to show a bit of reasoning behind my slight snark. I almost forgot to do the alt text for images.
